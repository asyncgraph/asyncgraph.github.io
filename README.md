# Async Graphs Generator

This repo provides a website application which can be used to automatically generate async graphs from log files provided by the [AsyncG](https://github.com/Haiyang-Sun/AsyncG) tool.

The async graphs generators is also available online at our website: <https://asyncgraph.github.io/>.

## Examples:

The website applications provides a set of code examples together with related AsyncG logs. Code examples are grouped in the following categories:

* reproduce
* promise
* emitter
* others

## Custom Node.js code:

To visualize the async graph of an arbitrary Node.js file the website application allows one to load the source code together with the log generated by the tool [AsyncG](https://github.com/Haiyang-Sun/AsyncG). Information about how to generate the log file can be found in the [readme file within AsyncG repository](https://github.com/Haiyang-Sun/AsyncG/blob/master/README.md).

## Run the generator locally:

The async graph generator can be run locally simply by opening the ```index.html``` file in a web browser.
